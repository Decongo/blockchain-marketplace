# blockchain-marketplace
Created by following the [tutorial released by DApp University](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH9Q2lf2mNo) on YouTube

This is a work in progress. Other than comments and a few minor changes, the project is almost identical to the project in the tutorial; however, I do plan on re-factoring and extending the source code as I see fit.

## Clone the repository
```
git init
```
```
git clone 
```

## Install dependencies
```
npm install
```

## Serve the project locally
```
npm run start
```

Access the web application at localhost:3000.
