# blockchain-marketplace
Created by following the [tutorial released by DApp University](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH9Q2lf2mNo) on YouTube

This is a work in progress. Other than comments and a few minor changes, the project is almost identical to the project in the tutorial; however, I do plan on re-factoring and extending the source code as I see fit.

## Clone the repository
In your unix shell, navigate to the directory where you would like this project to be located.

Initialize a local Git repository:

```
git init
```

Clone this repository into your current directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/Decongo/blockchain-marketplace.git
```

## Install dependencies

I used npm v9.10.0 and Node.js v5.6.0 to develop this project. I reccommend that you use the same or similar versions.  
Use npm to install the dependencies for this project:

```
npm install
```

In addition to these dependencies, please ensure that you have Ganache 2.1.1. You can download it [here](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache).

## Serve the project locally
```
npm run start
```

Access the web application at localhost:3000.
